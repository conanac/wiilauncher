[WiiLauncher](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiLauncher) is a simple alternative to [Gecko OS](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Gecko_OS) application. It has most of the [Gecko OS](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Gecko_OS) features and has additional features for downloading and editing cheat codes.

[WiiLauncher](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiLauncher) automatically reloads and patches IOS 36 so there is no need to install unofficial (patched) or even custom IOS to run the channels (with the debugger or cheat codes) or the rebooter features. Full hardware access (AHBPROT) is used when applying such run-time patches. This access could be obtained by running [WiiLauncher](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiLauncher) application from [Homebrew Channel](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel) (version 1.0.7 or higher).

**Important notes**

This wiibrew application has not been tested extensively, use cautiously. Since it writes to SD card (for saving the configuration and downloading cheat codes features), make sure you have a back-up of your important SD card content.
